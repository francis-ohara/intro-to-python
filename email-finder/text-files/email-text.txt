I must not fear.
Fear is the mind killer.
Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration.

Earth's sun is younger and brighter than Krypton's was.
Your cells have drunk in its radiation.
Strengthening your muscles; your skin; your senses.
Earth's gravity is weak yet its atmosphere is more nourishing.
You have grown stronger here than I ever could have imagined.
The only way to know how strong is to keep testing your limits.

You will give the people of earth an ideal to strive towards.
They will race behind you.
They will stumble.
They will fall.
But in time, they will join you in the sun Kal.
In time, you will help them accomplish wonders.

You are weak son of El; unsure of yourself.
The fact that you possess a sense of morality, and we do not, gives us an evolutionary advantage.
And if history has proven anything.
It is that evolution always wins.

But the bell has already been rung.
And they've heard it.
Not in the dark.
Amongst the stars.
The god is dead.

It can be cruel, poetic or blind.
But when it's denied, it is violence you may find.

They think I'm hiding in the shadows.
